# Travis Changelog

## v0.3.0 — Plugin platform + runtime pack selection (2026-05-08)

Packs become a real plugin format. Every primary table from every
enabled pack now renders as a Manage tab — list, detail, edit, delete
— with **zero pack-side UI code**. Pack authors ship schema metadata;
core materialises the UI dynamically. Custom React components are
optional, ship inside the pack, and override the auto-CRUD when the
UX warrants it. The pack-authoring guide is at
[`AUTHORING_PACKS.md`](./AUTHORING_PACKS.md).

### Highlights

- **Schema-driven auto-CRUD.** New `PackHandle::tables()` declares
  every typed table with rich field metadata (`FieldType` covers
  Text, LongText, Email, Phone, Integer, Number, Currency, Date,
  DateTime, Bool, Enum, Ref, Json, Timestamp). Generic Tauri commands
  (`pack_table_list / _get / _upsert / _delete`) build SQL from the
  metadata; SQL-injection-safe by construction.
- **Auto list / detail / form views.** Frontend `src/lib/autoCRUD/`
  contains type-aware components (`ListView`, `DetailView`,
  `FormView`, `FieldCell`, `FieldInput`) that render any pack's
  table. Sortable columns, click-to-detail, edit forms, two-click
  delete.
- **Custom UI overrides.** Pack-shipped React components live at
  `src/packs/<slug>/ui/` and register in `src/lib/packRegistry.ts`.
  The L2E `InvoicesTab` moves into the L2E pack and demonstrates
  the override path.
- **Operational alerts.** New `PackHandle::alerts()` returns
  `AlertDef` entries with severity (money / action / info) and SQL
  for the headline metric. The Splash screen renders these
  prominently above the entity stats. L2E ships *Hours not yet
  invoiced* + *Signing sheets awaiting signature*; tutoring ships
  *Progress reports drafted but not sent* + *No-show sessions to
  follow up*.
- **Runtime pack selection.** `meta.pack.<slug>.enabled` per DB
  decides which compiled-in packs participate. Onboarding step 8
  asks "What should Travis help with?"; Settings → Packs lets users
  toggle anytime. Cargo features stay as a build-time lever for
  distros (`--no-default-features --features pack-tutoring`).
- **Tutoring pack.** The second vertical pack ships in the default
  build, runtime-disabled by default. Validates that the abstraction
  isn't accidentally L2E-shaped — writing the second pack felt
  mechanical: declare schema, ship migrations, register entity
  kinds. No UI code, no Tauri commands.

### What this enables

A new vertical pack now needs only: `tables.rs` schema declarations,
a SQL migration, an entity-kinds list, a prompt fragment, an alert
or two. Roughly half a day from the right MARKET.md vertical to a
working pack with full UI. Custom UI is opt-in for places the
auto-CRUD shape doesn't suit.

### Migrations

No new core migrations in v0.3.0; pack metadata lives in compile-
time `&'static` data. The tutoring pack's `0001_init.sql` runs as
a per-pack migration, tracked in `meta.pack.tutoring.schema_version`.

### Breaking changes

None for end users on the default build. The L2E pack's invoice tab
is now sourced from `src/packs/lead_to_empower/ui/InvoicesTab.tsx`
instead of `src/manage/tabs/InvoicesTab.tsx` (path change only;
identical behaviour).

### Internal docs

- `PLUGIN_PLATFORM.md` — design spec; slices 1–7 shipped, slice 8
  (onboarding hooks) deferred per `DEFERRED.md`.
- `AUTHORING_PACKS.md` — comprehensive guide to building and
  evolving packs.

## v0.2.0 — Pack architecture (2026-05-07)

Travis is now generic at the data-model level. The vertical-specific
code that used to be baked into core (after-school enrichment program
ops — coaches, schools, signing sheets, NYC DoF invoicing) lives
entirely as an installable pack under
`src-tauri/src/packs/lead_to_empower/`. Future verticals — tutoring,
home care, therapy, field service — ship as their own packs and plug
into the same extension points.

### Highlights

- **Pack architecture.** New `PackHandle` trait declares a pack's
  slug, version, migrations, prompt fragment, entity kinds, action
  kinds, and registration hooks for tools and action handlers. Packs
  gate compilation behind a Cargo feature flag
  (`pack-lead-to-empower` is default-on).
- **Universal spine.** Three new core tables — `entity`, `relation`,
  `event` — give every domain object a place in a cross-pack
  rendezvous index. Packs sync their typed data into the spine via
  explicit writes, so retrieval and the future knowledge graph see
  one unified view.
- **Action + tool registries.** Action dispatch and tool registration
  are runtime registries that packs extend at startup. The static
  `actions::dispatch` match and the hardcoded
  `tools::read_only_registry` are gone.
- **Dynamic journal extraction.** The schema for the journal
  extraction LLM tool derives entity buckets and the
  `proposedActions` enum from the live pack registry. Adding a pack
  with new entity kinds doesn't require touching `journal.rs`.
- **Pack-supplied prompt fragments.** Each pack contributes a
  system-prompt fragment that's appended to journal, proactive,
  summary, and ask-Travis prompts.
- **Frontend pack gating.** The Manage tab list hides pack-supplied
  UI (the L2E Invoices tab) when the corresponding pack is disabled.
  `appStatus.enabledPacks` exposes the pack list.
- **`task` graduates to core.** L2E-specific `link_kind` CHECK
  constraint dropped; new `entity_id` column links to the spine.

### Migrations

- `0018_pack_spine.sql` — generalises `entity_index` → `entity`,
  adds `relation` and `event`.
- `0019_task_to_core.sql` — recreates `task` without the L2E CHECK
  constraint, adds `entity_id`.

Both run cleanly on a fresh DB. Existing dev installs that predate
the LF-pinning of migration files in `.gitattributes` may hit a
sqlx checksum drift on first launch (delete the data dir to reset).

### What this enables

Building the next vertical pack — tutoring, home care, therapy, MSP,
legal — is now scoped to creating a `src-tauri/src/packs/<slug>/`
directory with a `PackHandle` impl plus typed tables and Tauri
commands. No core changes needed. `MARKET.md` lists the 20 target
verticals; `PACKS.md` is the format spec.

### Breaking changes

None for end users on the default build. The L2E pack ships enabled
by default and behaves identically to v0.1.3.

### Internal docs

- `PACKS.md` — pack format spec.
- `PACKS_AUDIT.md` — full refactor record (12 steps).
- `ROADMAP.md` — Phase 1 marked shipped; remaining bullets cover the
  second-pack validation milestone.
