# Travis Changelog

## v0.2.0 — Pack architecture (2026-05-07)

Travis is now generic at the data-model level. The vertical-specific
code that used to be baked into core (after-school enrichment program
ops — coaches, schools, signing sheets, NYC DoF invoicing) lives
entirely as an installable pack under
`src-tauri/src/packs/lead_to_empower/`. Future verticals — tutoring,
home care, therapy, field service — ship as their own packs and plug
into the same extension points.

### Highlights

- **Pack architecture.** New `PackHandle` trait declares a pack's
  slug, version, migrations, prompt fragment, entity kinds, action
  kinds, and registration hooks for tools and action handlers. Packs
  gate compilation behind a Cargo feature flag
  (`pack-lead-to-empower` is default-on).
- **Universal spine.** Three new core tables — `entity`, `relation`,
  `event` — give every domain object a place in a cross-pack
  rendezvous index. Packs sync their typed data into the spine via
  explicit writes, so retrieval and the future knowledge graph see
  one unified view.
- **Action + tool registries.** Action dispatch and tool registration
  are runtime registries that packs extend at startup. The static
  `actions::dispatch` match and the hardcoded
  `tools::read_only_registry` are gone.
- **Dynamic journal extraction.** The schema for the journal
  extraction LLM tool derives entity buckets and the
  `proposedActions` enum from the live pack registry. Adding a pack
  with new entity kinds doesn't require touching `journal.rs`.
- **Pack-supplied prompt fragments.** Each pack contributes a
  system-prompt fragment that's appended to journal, proactive,
  summary, and ask-Travis prompts.
- **Frontend pack gating.** The Manage tab list hides pack-supplied
  UI (the L2E Invoices tab) when the corresponding pack is disabled.
  `appStatus.enabledPacks` exposes the pack list.
- **`task` graduates to core.** L2E-specific `link_kind` CHECK
  constraint dropped; new `entity_id` column links to the spine.

### Migrations

- `0018_pack_spine.sql` — generalises `entity_index` → `entity`,
  adds `relation` and `event`.
- `0019_task_to_core.sql` — recreates `task` without the L2E CHECK
  constraint, adds `entity_id`.

Both run cleanly on a fresh DB. Existing dev installs that predate
the LF-pinning of migration files in `.gitattributes` may hit a
sqlx checksum drift on first launch (delete the data dir to reset).

### What this enables

Building the next vertical pack — tutoring, home care, therapy, MSP,
legal — is now scoped to creating a `src-tauri/src/packs/<slug>/`
directory with a `PackHandle` impl plus typed tables and Tauri
commands. No core changes needed. `MARKET.md` lists the 20 target
verticals; `PACKS.md` is the format spec.

### Breaking changes

None for end users on the default build. The L2E pack ships enabled
by default and behaves identically to v0.1.3.

### Internal docs

- `PACKS.md` — pack format spec.
- `PACKS_AUDIT.md` — full refactor record (12 steps).
- `ROADMAP.md` — Phase 1 marked shipped; remaining bullets cover the
  second-pack validation milestone.
